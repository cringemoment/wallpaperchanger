## Prereqs:
### http://openweathermap.org/ API key
 
### https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/ - Pillow
 
### https://pypi.org/project/geopy/ - GeoPy

### https://pypi.org/project/requests/ - requests

Note: This will probably only work on windows
Also, a lot of the image files are missing for other weather events, such as rain and some snow. Add them yourselves, if you're up for the challenge.
